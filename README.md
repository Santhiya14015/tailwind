**About the Project**

This is a personal portfolio website thoughtfully crafted using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It showcases who I am — from my introduction, skills, and education to my internship journey and project highlights. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

**My Experience**

Working on this portfolio has been a transformative experience in my journey as a developer. I explored the power of Tailwind CSS to build clean, responsive layouts without writing a single line of custom CSS. From structuring content to managing utility-first classes, I learned how to create aesthetically pleasing and well-organized sections.
This project boosted my confidence in frontend development and allowed me to express my creativity through code — bringing my professional identity to life on the web.
